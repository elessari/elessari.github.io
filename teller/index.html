    <h1>Teller Project</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Teller was a grad course project to design and prototype an app solution for finance tracking. Over the course of a semester, I worked in a small team to gather requirements for the app through contextual inquiries and affinity diagrams, which lead into early sketches of potential solutions, with a finalized prototype of testable features of medium-fidelity for desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Teller began with defining a target audience to help users who desire a better way to track their finances. After conducting contextual inquiries and defining key pain points, it was decided to proceed with an app that would track spending habits, manage stock portfolios, and allow users to see all their credit and bank accounts at a glance. Six key areas of focus were decided following the affinity diagram, including data security for financial information; offering a digital platform for users to take advantage of; empathy for user concerns related to financial matters; advice for those beginning their ledger and/or stock portfolio; financial planning for goal-oriented users; and stock portfolio tracking with live updates of the NASDAQ.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Sketches of the initial ideas for the application were developed from data points of the affinity diagram, taking into account common themes and user requirements.</p>

      <br><h2 style="margin-left: 1rem">Don't forget to put sketches here</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
    <div><p>Iterations of the early sketches led into the development of the higher-fidelity prototypes, displaying minor functionality to allow for user testing and refinement of core features of the application. Screen states were kept simple to focus on the most relevant information to the user, as data found that users may prefer to simply take a glance at their accounts and not spend too long looking at the app.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-left:1rem;">don't forget to put designs here</h2>

    <p>The interactive prototype, shown below for testing purposes, allows the user to navigate through the application and get a sense for core functionality and the purpose of each section provided in the higher-fidelity designs.</p>
    <figure><iframe style="border: none;margin-left:1rem;box-shadow:2px 2px 2px #ddd;" width="300" height="550" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FqDuhgvyIrZmXd02MP846Ue%2FTeller%3Fnode-id%3D77%253A30%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption style="margin-top:.75rem">Interactive prototype in Figma</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
    <p>Screens of the desktop interface are shown below; despite not adding core functionality to these screens, they were optimal for allowing users to view the application from a different interface with the option to track their finances from a different device.</p>
    <h2 style="margin-left:1rem">Don't forget to put screens here</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
    <div><p>The development of the project concluded at the development of testable prototypes, with user testing done as a continuation of the project thereafter. Initial user testing involved a short tasklist to gauge a user's ability to navigate the application and accomplish tasks such as adding cards to their account, viewing their portfolio, and setting goals within the app. Results of testing indicate potential for future refinement, with the app missing some desired features and confusion over wording of financial terms for the less experienced user. </p>
