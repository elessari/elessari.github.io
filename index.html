        <h2>Supplemental Instruction at RIT</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The Supplemental Instruction (SI) program is designed to support students enrolled in historically difficult courses at RIT. Through structured weekly sessions in an academic setting, students and their SI Leaders work together to learn and succeed in and out of the classroom.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Students enrolled in courses supported by SI often found themselves with little way to contact their SI Leader outside the classroom aside from email, and also were left unable to check next meeting topics or times without scouring the RIT Academic Support Center site. How could the communication between SI Leaders and their students be improved?</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Solving the Problem</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Before starting on sketches of a potential prototype solution, I first set out to work out the different users of a SI application, and what their requirements and use cases might be. Following is a comparison of different types of users of this application and their needs.</p>
          <img src="assets/images/si/requirements.png" class="modal-image">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>sketches</h2>
        <div><p>Next I began sketching different layouts for several screen states and the interfaces for student and employee applications. My intent was to create one app with differing interaction components based on which type of user was currently accessing the application.</p>

        <h2>Car Dashboard UI</h2>
        <div>
          <p>In most modern cars, you’ll find the analog dashboard of times past has been replaced with digital touchscreens as the era of smartphones engulfs the world. However, in most states in the US, using your phone while driving is illegal, and for good reason. Does the inclusion of touchscreens in cars impede one’s ability to pay attention to the road while driving? Between analog and digital, which is the best to ensure a pleasant user experience while interacting with the car while also ensuring the safety of the driver and passengers?</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Given a set of user data from a survey conducted by the UX Club, I began my solutions with sketches of potential interface layouts and the design considerations behind them. Sketches involved the consideration of more popular choices from the survey populus as well as anecdotal experience from different types of car interfaces.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>After refining some of my sketches, I developed the first prototypes of what the center console and dashboard interfaces could look like, and what interactions they might afford the user.</p>
          <img src="assets/images/car-dash/console.png">
          <p>Here, the center console offers physical buttons to accompany a more modern touchscreen interface, to provide the user with a variety of options for controlling different features. The center console is accompanied by physical control buttons placed conveniently on the steering wheel to allow users to switch between screen displays and controls quickly and efficiently, without needing to take their eyes off the road. Changing a control setting would emit an audible noise to notify the user of successful state change, as well as haptic feedback on the steering wheel (with customization settings) for deaf and other impaired users.</p>
          <br/>
          <img src="assets/images/car-dash/dashboard.png">
          <p>Meanwhile, my initial idea for the car dashboard itself was to make information as simple as possible, such that a user would need only to glance momentarily at the dash and not be distracted from driving. The service lights commonly displayed on car dashboards would display only as needed on the left-hand side of the dashboard, with large, short text to inform the user of potential actions to take. The middle of the dash would contain RPM and speedometer information, as well as the fuel gauge and car mileage information. The right-hand side of the dash would then be more modular, adapting its display to the current display of the center console, making control and modification of the center console more easy to do without the driver having to take their eyes off the road or hands off the wheel.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/images/car-dash/center_console.png" width="90%" height="auto">
          <p>My higher fidelity solution for the center console ended up quite similar to the first drafts, with a few tweaks to accommodate usability. The display uses high-contrast colors to help users indicate where they currently are and the content of the display. Again, use of text is kept minimal to not distract the user. Concurrent events are displayed on the right-hand side of the screen, to not interfere with the current display but allow users to see music playing while GPS navigation is on, and would have similar functionality for climate control and phone pairing as well. Settings for the center console would allow the user to change colors of the display, brightness, icons, sounds, and text size, to accommodate modularity and more personalization.</p>
          <br/>
          <img src="assets/images/car-dash/car_dashboard.png" width="90%" height="auto">
          <p>As for the car dashboard, most of the first draft designs found their way into the final mockup with smaller alterations. The left-hand information panel now shows two sections, one for general information with space for car status (e.g. cruise control, directional lights on, auto windshield wipers, etc). The service lights only display lights that are currently on, alongside their resolution for the user to take action. The speedometer and fuel gauge offer different color gauges to indicate current status; for instance, the fuel gauge will turn red when the fuel is low. The right-hand side mirrors the current center console display, complete with any critical information to assist the user - in this case, navigation directions.</p>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <h2>Considerations</h2>
        <div>
          <p>My solution for the car dashboard aligned with helping to keep drivers as focused on the road on possible, and limit potential distractions made by these interfaces. The interface solutions are intended to be easy to see and glance at while in the car, with physical buttons and haptic feedback incorporated to allow users to get feedback on their inputs made without having to constantly look at the screen. Incorporating user data, my goal was to ensure driver and passenger safety above all, with minimal design to allow only the most critical information to be relevant at most times. These features are intended to be customizable to accommodate a wider range of users who may feel more comfortable on the road and feel lesser need for distraction prevention. User testing of these designs are a future consideration to improve and refine the concepts displayed and ensure the interface is able to accomplish these goals and more.</p>

          I'm a 5th-year Human-Centered Computing student at Rochester Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2020 and currently searching for full-time opportunities.<br><br>
          My drive for UX was borne from a young age, as growing up I observed relatives and friends struggle to use technology or experience frustrating roadblocks. My goal has always been to make technology friendly and easy to use for everyone, taking every user into consideration.<br><br>
          Outside of UX design and development, I love to experience as many forms of art as I can. I create my own calligraphy and always find myself engrossed in books or in games with rich stories. I believe that sharing in artistic expressions of the human experience is vital to understanding and empathizing with users of every demographic, and creating a truly personalized user experience.<br><br>
