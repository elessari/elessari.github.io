    <h1>Supplemental Instruction @ RIT</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 id="problem">Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Supplemental Instruction at RIT is an academic program that is designed to aid underclassmen in notoriously difficult courses by appointing peer leaders to engage and help currently enrolled students. The SI at RIT app was a project undertaken to help employees of the program and students alike navigate the complex directory that the program had to offered, and centralize a platform for the community to utilize. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As a prior employee of the SI program, I was privy to the complex information architecture of the program and the pain points of navigating such a system. After evaluating the previous mobile application, I had decided to undergo redesigning the application. I set the goal of making the application a more centralized platform for SI, and making it easy to use for everyone, whether they were a student or an employee. Requirements gathering was accomplished by chatting with my coworkers and the students I mentored to get a gauge for possible pain points I looked over, and how a redesigned application might address these problems.</p>
      <figure><img src="../assets/images/si/requirements.png" width="95%" style="border: 10px solid white; padding: 0; margin: 1em;box-shadow:2px 2px 2px #ddd;"><figcaption>Requirements gathering, categorized by user</figcaption></figure>
      <p>Sketching out solutions and affordances for said requirements, I made an early design choice that split my work amongst my two perceived target audiences: students and employees. The app from sketch to hi-fi was designed with two separate interfaces in mind, combined in one application under the guise of distinguishing users. Seeing as these two focus groups had differing requirements, I felt it best to accommodate their needs as directly as possible.</p>
      <!-- <h2 style="margin-left:1rem">don't forget to put sketches here</h2> -->
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
    <div><p>Hi-fi prototypes were developed after receiving feedback on the lo-fi sketches and deciding what feedback to implement as changes to layout and functionality. Prototypes were designed in Figma and animated using InVision to showcase ideas for possibility app interactions without implementation of a fully-fledged mobile app. The interactive prototype can be viewed <a href="https://invis.io/YRGQNJ05ZFW" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
    <div><p>The results of user testing suggested some potential changes to refine within the prototypes to enhance the experience for all users. App implentation wasn't possible at the time, as my employers lacked the necessary funding to support a complete application overhaul. That said, the opportunity to redesign of the SI at RIT app was able to show the potential for a centralized platform for a small community to utilize as a means of more efficient productivity on the job and ease of communication between SI leaders and students.</p>
